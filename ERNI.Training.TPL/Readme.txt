Task Parallel Library and async/await technical training

This solution contains exercises for technical training about TPL and async/await in C#.
Each exercise contains 3 files:
- Test.cs - unit tests, which should be green after finishing exercise.
- Implement.cs - file that you should implement your code in. Also includes description of exercise.
- Input.cs (optional) - types, which represents input and/or output of tests.

Do not change any other file than Implement.cs.

Tests are just guidance, but do not represent full coverage of exercise. Tests might be green, even though implementation might be wrong.
For some exercises tests are already green. In these exercises you are supposed to convert sequential algorithm to parallel one.
Some tests may randomly fail, even though implementation is correct. This is caused by non-deterministic behavior of .NET scheduler.
